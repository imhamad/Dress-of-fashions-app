			<div class="pp_content">
				<h3>What we collect (Information about you)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Registration and Account Information:</b>  <br> <p>When you use our various services you voluntarily give us personal information (e.g., first and last, university, course and year of study, E-mail address, birth date, age, phone number and, when necessary, billing information) and you are not anonymous to us. That means your name and photo (if you choose to provide them) will be visible to other DressVibe users and they can search you by name unless you change your settings. </p></li>
					<li><b>Social Media Information: </b>  <br> <p>If you sign in to your DressVibe account through third-party social media sites like Facebook or Linkedin, you agree to give us on-going access to your personal information on such sites (e.g., your public profile, friend list, accounts you follow or who follow you, your email address, birthday, work history, education history, interests, current city, and video viewing). We may receive certain information about you which is stored on social media sites if users of those sites give us access to their profiles and you are one of their friends or connections, depending upon your settings on those sites.</p></li>
					<li><b>Information from Other Sources:</b>   <br> <p>The information we collect may be combined with information from outside records (e.g. demographic information and additional contact information) that we have received in accordance with the law.</p></li>
					<li><b>Type of device and Location Information:</b>   <br> <p>We collect additional information when you access our App through a certain device (e.g. your mobile device’s unique identifier; your session’s ip address; information about your device’s operating system, your browser, browser or operating system language; your wireless network, and your mobile carrier. We may also collect your WPS location data – you can choose whether to allow this by changing your geolocation tracking settings.</p></li>
				</ul>

				

				<h3>Uses and Retention of information collected</h3>
				<p>We use your Registration and Account information to </p>

				<ul>
					<li>Make our service available </li>
					<li>Improve our Services</li>
					<li>Provide Interesting Offerings to You and others </li>
					<li>Process your Payments </li>
					<li>Prevent fraud &amp; spam</li>
					<li>Communicate With You</li>

				</ul>

				<p><b>Data Retention: </b> Unless otherwise specified, we retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for us to achieve the purposes referred to above or to enable us to comply with our legal data protection retention obligations. Upon deactivation of your account, we will minimize the personal data we keep about you only to such data which we are required to keep to comply with laws, or other legal reasons. We may keep activity data on a non-identifiable basis to improve our services. Your posts on public accounts and communities may remain available if you do not delete them.</p>

				<h3>Disclosure</h3>
				<p>Your data is kept safe with us, but we do share your personal information with third parties we trust in order to provide you with our services, as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The DressVibe Corporate Family: including our parent company, FireBull Tech Limited, Nigeria. (RC 1618383).</li>
					<li>App providers and other Third-Parties </li>
					<li>Advertising partners </li>
					<li>Legal and Law Enforcement </li>
					<li>Change of Control – New owners: We may share your information with another business entity, if we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business, or are involved in a transaction with similar financial effect. </li>
				</ul>


				<h3>Information You Share Publicly</h3>
				<p>DressVibe allow you to share information with others on a public basis. If you post information on a public feature of our Services or through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, do not forget this information is public on our Services and, depending upon your privacy settings, may also become public on the Internet. When you post on Communities, the app admin has the ability to allow everybody to access it, but you can always actively delete messages you posted. We cannot prevent or control further use of this information so please make sure you only post information that you are happy to be seen publicly. We may also further use such public information you share, for various reasons, such as improving our service and providing you with relevant content and analyzing trends.</p>
				<p>You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. Please refer to those third-party sites’ privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, as we do not control these.</p>

				<p>At this stage, whatever you share publicly is available to the entire DressVibe community. If you wish to remove a certain piece of content you have shared in the past, you can do that by deleting that content. It will be removed from our services but may remain on local devices of some users (assuming they have chosen to save it).</p>

				<h3>Your Rights</h3>

				<p>We want you to have control over how you communicate. That is why, for example, we allow you to delete posts even after they have been uploaded (it will be deleted for you, your friend and our service). Isn’t that cool? </p>
				<p>Every now and then, DressVibe may send you updates about administration and operation of the Service (for example, about your transactions, policy changes, technical issues, etc.). We may also send notifications about offerings by DressVibe or third-parties, that we think may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such notifications, you may adjust your system settings to decline them.</p>


				<h3>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
				<p>When you visit the App and/or our Website, we and our business partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies for a variety of purposes.</p>


				<h3>Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Personal Information</h3>
				<p>As a registered member, you can review and change personal information at any time by accessing your account on the App or contacting our support. Please be sure to update your personal information promptly if it changes or becomes inaccurate. We may retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze, or troubleshoot programs, enforce our Terms of Use, or take other actions permitted by law. Likewise, if your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we may maintain some information to prevent you from re-registering.</p>


				<h3>Third-Party websites</h3>
				<p>Our app contains links to other third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party sites.</p>

				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>We know that security is important to our users and we care about the security of your information. We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures to protect the security of your personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. </p>



				<h3>Contact Us</h3>
				<p>If you still have questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to send us an email to <a href="mailto:info@DressVibe.com" target="_blank">info@DressVibe.com</a>  </p>
